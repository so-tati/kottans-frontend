#### 0 Git intro

* [ ] Finish the course [Version Control with Git](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123)

I've already worked with git locally, so this topic is not someting brand new to me. Though, I liked the way the material is performed in this course, it seems well-structured and covers the very first steps for exploring version control system.

* [ ] Complete the following levels at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org):

I've discovered a ```rebase``` command: it is used when we want to make it look like two features were developed sequentially in one branch, when in reality they were developed in parallel in different branches.

![Main: Introduction Sequence](task0/02.jpg)

Practicing git remotes while faking a teamwork was all new to me. I've discovered the difference between ```rebase``` and ```merge```(creates new commit), uncovered the inner nature of ```pull``` (which is ```fetch``` combined with ```merge``` ). Also I've learned how to solve conflicts with locked master branch. I will definitely use this knowledge in future!

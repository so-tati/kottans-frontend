#### 0 Git intro

* [x] Finish the course [Version Control with Git](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123)

I've already worked with git locally, so this topic is not someting brand new to me. Though, I liked the way the material is performed in this course, it seems well-structured and covers the very first steps for exploring version control system.

* [x] Complete the following levels at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org):

I've discovered a ```rebase``` command: it is used when we want to make it look like two features were developed sequentially in one branch, when in reality they were developed in parallel in different branches.

Practicing git remotes while faking a teamwork was all new to me. I've discovered the difference between ```rebase``` and ```merge```(creates new commit), uncovered the inner nature of ```pull``` (which is ```fetch``` combined with ```merge``` ). Also I've learned how to solve conflicts with locked master branch. I will definitely use this knowledge in future!

* [x] Send a [pull-request](https://github.com/kottans/mock-repo/pull/553) to Kottans/mock-repo proposing a change.
This was a really cool experience! Sending a pull request was absolutely new to me and now I feel more confident with git.
